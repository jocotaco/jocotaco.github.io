    <h1>Project 1: Images of the Russian Empire -- Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection </h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Below are three selfies that I took on an iPhone 13 Pro. As you can see, there is a decrease in the distortion of my selfies as the phone is 
        pulled further away from me. Indeed, my last and third portrait looks much better than my first one. I believe this phenomenon exists because when the camera lens
        is close to my face, nearby objects take up more of the visual field, making my nose appear disproportionately big and my forehead and cheeks stretched. On the flip side, when I step back and zoom in,
        the distance now evens out the proportions and the zoom changes the field of view.
    </p>
    

    <h2>Experimental Results</h2>
    <h3>Part 1: Single-scale Alignment (with Euclidean Distance / L2)</h3>
    <p>Below are two sets of images taken of "urban scenes," but one set is of the School of Optometry's hallways and the other set is of foresty roads. 
        I took the photos on a Samsung Galaxy S21+: once at 3x zoom and once at 1x zoom but closer down the halls and roads. What I noticed about the hallways is that when taken without zoom,
        the lockers look elongated and stretched out while when taken with zoom, the lockers are squished together. I even made sure to take the photos in reference to the same walls. For the forest roads,
        what immediately stuck out to me was the telephone lines: it's clear that the non-zoomed photo has steeper telephone lines compared to the zoomed photo. I postulate this is the same principle
        of perspective, in which by starting far back and zooming in, the field of view is narrow. However, when I walk forward and don't use zoom, the field of view is wide and causes the exaggerated stretch.

    <h3>Part 2: Multi-scale Pyramid Alignment (with NCC)</h3>
    <p>Below is the Dolly Zoom gif of a Mazda Miata car. I started with a 0.5x zoomed out close-up shot of the car. Then, I walked backwards while simultaneously zooming in on my Samsung S21+ phone. I tried
        to keep the Miata a consistent size in the scene. We can see a slight dolly effect when the gif is played at a fast speed with the trees and sky in the background becoming stretched and warped. After watching
        my gif a few times, I almost felt like I had vertigo!
