    <h1>Project 0: Becoming Friends with Your Camera</h1>
    <h2>Selfie: The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way</h2>
    <p>Below are three selfies that I took on an iPhone 13 Pro. As you can see, there is a decrease in the distortion of my selfies as the phone is 
        pulled further away from me. Indeed, my last and third portrait looks much better than my first one. I believe this phenomenon exists because when the camera lens
        is close to my face, nearby objects take up more of the visual field, making my nose appear disproportionately big and my forehead and cheeks stretched. On the flip side, when I step back and zoom in,
        the distance now evens out the proportions and the zoom changes the field of view.

            <p>Wrong way: 0.5x zoom (Largest field of view)</p>

            <p>Slightly less wrong: 1x zoom</p>

            <p>Right way: 3x zoom (Smallest field of view)</p>

    <h2>Architectural Perspective Compression</h2>
    <p>Below are two sets of images taken of "urban scenes," but one set is of the School of Optometry's hallways and the other set is of foresty roads. 
        I took the photos on a Samsung Galaxy S21+: once at 3x zoom and once at 1x zoom but closer down the halls and roads. What I noticed about the hallways is that when taken without zoom,
        the lockers look elongated and stretched out while when taken with zoom, the lockers are squished together. I even made sure to take the photos in reference to the same walls. For the forest roads,
        what immediately stuck out to me was the telephone lines: it's clear that the non-zoomed photo has steeper telephone lines compared to the zoomed photo. I postulate this is the same principle
        of perspective, in which by starting far back and zooming in, the field of view is narrow. However, when I walk forward and don't use zoom, the field of view is wide and causes the exaggerated stretch.

    <h2>The Dolly Zoom</h2>
    <p>Below is the Dolly Zoom gif of a Mazda Miata car. I started with a 0.5x zoomed out close-up shot of the car. Then, I walked backwards while simultaneously zooming in on my Samsung S21+ phone. I tried
        to keep the Miata a consistent size in the scene. We can see a slight dolly effect when the gif is played at a fast speed with the trees and sky in the background becoming stretched and warped. After watching
        my gif a few times, I almost felt like I had vertigo!

            <p>Slowed down gif for a frame-by-frame compilation of still images of the Miata</p>

        <div class="img-text">
            <img src="dolly_2.gif" />
            <p>The sped up gif starts to demonstrate effects of the dolly zoom with the Miata in focus. Very cool!</p>
